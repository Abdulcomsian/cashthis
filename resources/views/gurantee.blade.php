            <div class="heading-2">Shop with Confidence!</div>
            <div class="para">Enjoy the peace of mind with our 100% Risk-Free 45-Day Money-Back Guarantee on all
                discounted gift cards at Cashthis. Our valued customers leverage pre-owned discounted gift cards to save
                on every purchase. We stand by our promise that every gift card you acquire from Cashthis will remain

            <div class="heading-2">Why do gift cards lose their value?</div>
            <div class="para">Unlike perishable items like milk, gift cards don't naturally deteriorate. The two primary
                reasons behind gift card balance depletion are as follows: </div>
            <ul class="mt-2">
                <li class="list-para">The card was initially purchased with a stolen credit card and subsequently
                    invalidated by the issuing company. </li>
                <li class="list-para">The original cardholder continued to use the card number after selling it to
                    Cashthis.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="heading-2">How can you safeguard yourself?</div>
            <div class="para">To protect yourself from unscrupulous sellers and potentially fraudulent gift cards,
                consider these simple precautions:</div>
            <ul class="mt-2">
                <li class="list-para"> Verify your gift card balance before making any purchases.</li>
                <li class="list-para"> Utilize the entire card balance within 45 days of your purchase. It's crucial to
                    note that even if the balance appeared correct when checked within the initial 45 days, the
                    guarantee expires after this period. All you need to do is use the card within this timeframe.</li>
                <li class="lis-para"> Notify us of any balance discrepancies within 45 days of your purchase by emailing
                    claims@cashthis.com.</li>
            </ul>
